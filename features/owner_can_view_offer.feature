Feature: Owner can view offers on Listing page
  As a cat owner,
  In order to choose host for my cat
  I need to be able to view the offers for my listing

  Background: Offers exist on a listing
    Given the following user exist
      | email              | password |
      | george@saloniki.gr | password |
    
    Given the following listings exist
    | pet_name  | pet_location    | pet_description   | start_date      | end_date      | pet_picture |
    | Leif      | Gothenburg      | I'm nice          | 2019-06-28      | 2019-06-29    | picture1    |
    | Ace       | Stockholm       | I'm nice          | 2019-06-28      | 2019-06-29    | picture2    |
    
    And the following offers exists on a listing
    | name   | email           | location      | price  | listing |    
    | Felix  | felix@craft.se  | Gothenburg    | 100    | Leif    |
    
    And I am logged in as "george@saloniki.gr"
    And I visit the landing page
  
  Scenario: Owner can click on listing and see correct offers in that listing
    When I click on "Show listing" within "Leif" section
    Then I should be on the "Leif" listing page
    And I should see "Leif"
    #And I should see "picture1"
    And I should see "Dates: 2019-06-28 to 2019-06-29" 
    And I should see "Offers"
    And I should see "Felix"
    And I should see "felix@craft.se"
    And I should see "Gothenburg"
    And I should see "100 kr"
    And I should see "Accept offer"
    And I should not see "There are no offers on this listing"

  Scenario: Owner can click on listing and see "There are no offers for this listing" if that is the case
    When I click on "Show listing" within "Ace" section
    Then I should be on the "Ace" listing page
    And I should see "There are no offers on this listing"
